# LocalFocus Widget API

### Build on top of LocalFocus visualisations

Users can create visualisations with LocalFocus and embed them via iframes. At LocalFocus we call these iframes widgets. The Widget API is an extra javascript layer for developers to do things like event handling, interacting and manipulating. The Widget API is not a full-blown library to create charts, but helps you to create extra functionalities.
